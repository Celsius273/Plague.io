# React Test

### What is this?

This is a simple as can be react project made as a setup exercise.
It's written in glorious ES6 (without all those pesky semicolons), and the Flux architecture and alt.

### How to run it?

Simply clone the repo, run 'npm install' to install all the requisite node modules, then run 'npm run-script build'

The built js file is **build/react_test.js** and you can see the app's main page in **public/react_test.html**

### Anything else?

When running the app, you can install [alt-devtool](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt-devtool) to see the current state of the TestStore store and all actions dispatched.
